            <p>One of the few photos in this series to include a person. Also one of the few that suggests movement of any kind. I usually close the shutter if I see a car coming and then restart the exposure. I had thoughts of editing it out because of that, but my wife really likes it so it stays. She has better intuition about these things than I do.</p>
            <p>We traveled to Cuba in 2016, just after the death of Fidel Castro. Our taxi was literally behind the last car of the funeral procession as it traveled down the Malecón. It was a strange time to be in Cuba. Well I assume it was, since I don't have any other Cuba experiences to compare it to.</p>
            <p>There was a moratorium on music, drinking, and dancing the whole time we were there. These photos really reflect the quiet atmosphere of Havana I felt during that time.</p>
