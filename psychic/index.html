    <p>This photo was taken somewhere in Sacramento, but I don't rememeber exactly where. It was from a trip to the city while I was still living in Arizona.</p>
    <p>This is one of those scenes that wouldn't work so well in the day time. There is something about lit neon signs that almost convinces me that the person inside could offer supernatural insight. Almost.</p>
