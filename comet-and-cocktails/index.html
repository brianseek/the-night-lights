          <p>This is the view of the backdoor of the Bikini Lounge in Phoenix Arizona. The Bikini Lounge is Phoenix's oldest tiki bar. Its not really a tiki bar, more of a tiki themed dive bar. Expect a long sideeye if you attempt to order a tropical drink, or anthing other than domestic beer really. But it's a good vibe.</p>
          <p>Also seen in this photograph is my jalopy, a 1963 Mercury Comet. This is my daily driven car and comes in handy to insert something interesting into an otherwise mundane scene. This is the only photograph featuring my car that I selected for this set of night lights.</p>
