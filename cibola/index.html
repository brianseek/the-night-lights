          <p>This is photograph is one of the oldest featured in this exhibit. I was still getting my footing with long exposure photos. I had not quite landed on my formula for calucalting exposure, but this photo was a major step towards figuring it out.</p>
          <p>This is on Main street in Mesa Arizona, a road famous for its intact mid-century neon motel signs. I think the absense of neon makes this one interesting. I'm not sure why, maybe it's just easy to overlook when outshined by the bright neon signs.</p>
