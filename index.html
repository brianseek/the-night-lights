  <h1>The Night Lights</h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      There is something comforting about the buzzing sounds of fluorescent and neon lights when all else is quiet. They remind me of the sleepy desert towns I grew up in. That feeling is what initially drew me into long-exposure landscapes. Seeing familiar or ordinary places transformed into dramatic flood-lit scenes is what has kept me coming back to making these photos over and over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started creating this collection of photographs around 2012. It became a part of everything I did. If I worked late, that was an opportunity to take some photos on my way home. On vacation, my wife and I would venture around at night to observe the sights under artificial light. It’s a great way to see familiar places close to home in a new way, too.
    </p>

      I find that I have less photographic anxiety at night. I’m not chasing perfect light or stressing about being set up at a location at a specific time. Honestly, the most appealing thing to me is that I don’t need to wake up early. Another nice thing is that no fast lenses, high-tech cameras, or other expensive equipment are required to pull it off. You only need a sturdy tripod, a decent light meter, and some patience.

      I find that the slow and quiet experience of making long exposures at night is mirrored by the solitude spent in the darkroom printing under a similar comforting buzzing light.
