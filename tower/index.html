          <p>Most viewers at this exhibition will imeadiatly recognize this place. The Tower Theator is a local celebrity of a building. I took this photo while my wife and I were just visting Sacramento, before we took the plunge and moved here.</p>
          <p>It was lucky timing that the theator was showing Ladybird, a movie directed by another Sacramento celebrity. This makes this my "most Sacramento" photo ever.</p>
          <p>We ended up seeing Thoroughbreds because we had already seen Ladybird.</p>
